# Modern Python with AIDD

**Learn Python fundamentals while developing AI collaboration skills**

A comprehensive, beginner-friendly Python course built on the **AI-Driven Development (AIDD)** pedagogical framework. This course integrates AI tools as learning partners, teaching you both Python and effective AI collaboration.

## What's This?

This is an educational course for learning Python from scratch. It's different because:

- ‚úÖ **Starts simple** (Chapter 1 = installing Python, not "advanced decorators")
- ‚úÖ **Uses real AI tools** (Claude Code, ChatGPT, Gemini) as part of learning
- ‚úÖ **Balances AI with independence** (You code manually to prove you can)
- ‚úÖ **Teaches debugging** (Fixing broken code is how you learn)
- ‚úÖ **Includes reflection** (Thinking about what you learned matters)

## Quick Start

**Just starting?**
1. Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed
2. Open [index.md](./index.md)
3. Go to [Chapter 1](./01-getting-started.md)
4. Follow along for 90 minutes

**Already have Python experience?**
- You might skip to Chapter 3 or later, but we recommend starting at Chapter 1 for AI collaboration patterns

## How Learning Works Here

### The 5-Phase AIDD Framework

Every chapter follows this proven learning pattern:

#### üß© Phase 1: Manual Concept Discovery (30 min)
You code by hand without AI. This builds real understanding.

```python
# You write this yourself
print("Hello, Python!")
```

#### ü§ñ Phase 2: AI Exploration & Comparison (25 min)
You see how AI approaches the same problem. Expands your perspective.

```
Prompt: "Show me 5 different ways to print text"
AI shows: 5 approaches with explanations
```

#### üß† Phase 3: Reverse Engineering & Debugging (20 min)
You fix broken AI code. Cements syntax understanding.

```python
# AI generated broken code (intentionally)
print Hello, World!  # Missing quotes - FIX THIS

# You fix it
print("Hello, World!")  # ‚úÖ Now it works
```

#### üí° Phase 4: Creative AI Collaboration (10 min)
You solve a harder problem WITH AI. Applies what you learned.

```
You: "Write code that..."
AI: [gives you code]
You: [modify it to solve your specific problem]
```

#### üß± Phase 5: Manual Reinforcement Challenge (15 min)
**NO AI ALLOWED**. You code independently to prove you understand.

```python
# Write this with zero AI help
# Must run without errors
# Must work correctly
```

### Why This Works

1. **Manual first** ‚Üí You build real understanding
2. **AI shows alternatives** ‚Üí You see multiple approaches
3. **Debugging cements it** ‚Üí Breaking things teaches syntax
4. **Collaboration applies it** ‚Üí You solve real problems
5. **Independent proof** ‚Üí You KNOW you can code solo

After each chapter, you genuinely understand the concept.

## What You Need

### Absolute Minimum
- Python 3.8+ installed on your computer
- A text editor (even Notepad works, but VS Code is better)
- Terminal/Command Prompt access
- Internet connection

### Recommended
- **VS Code** (free, best editor for Python beginners)
- **One AI tool**: Claude Code, ChatGPT, Gemini, or GitHub Copilot
- **15-30 minutes per day** for 12 weeks
- **Willingness to make mistakes** (essential!)

### Nice to Have
- **GitHub account** (free, for sharing code later)
- **Note-taking app** for reflection journals
- **Experienced programmer friend** to ask questions

## Installation Help

### Windows
1. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download Python 3.11+ (latest stable version)
3. Run installer ‚Üí **CHECK "Add Python to PATH"** ‚Üê Important!
4. Open Command Prompt, type: `python --version`
5. Should see: `Python 3.11.x` (exact version doesn't matter)

### Mac
```bash
brew install python3
python3 --version
```

### Linux
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3
python3 --version
```

**Problem?** Go to Chapter 1's troubleshooting section.

## Learning Path

### If You're Completely New to Programming
Do chapters in order: 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 12

This teaches fundamentals first, advanced concepts later.

### If You Know Programming But Not Python
Consider starting at Chapter 2 (variables) or Chapter 3 (conditionals).

Chapter 1 covers basics you might already know, but the AI collaboration patterns are still worth learning.

### If You Know Python
You might use this for AI collaboration patterns:
- Focus on Phase 2 (AI exploration)
- Focus on Phase 4 (AI collaboration)
- Maybe skip some phases, but not Phase 5!

## For Students

### Your Goals Each Chapter
- [ ] Understand the concept deeply
- [ ] Write code manually (no copy-paste)
- [ ] Fix broken code to understand errors
- [ ] Use AI effectively (ask good questions)
- [ ] Prove you understand (complete Phase 5)

### Red Flags (Don't Do These!)
- ‚ùå Copying code from AI without understanding it
- ‚ùå Skipping Phase 5 (manual challenge)
- ‚ùå Not reading error messages
- ‚ùå Rushing through Phase 1 (this builds your foundation!)
- ‚ùå Giving up after one error (all programmers get errors constantly)

### Tips for Success
1. **Code along** with examples, don't just read
2. **Make mistakes intentionally** - error messages are teachers
3. **Read the error message** - seriously, always read it
4. **Explain code to someone else** (even if that's just yourself)
5. **Reflect on what you learned** - don't skip this
6. **Do homework** - it cements understanding
7. **Take breaks** - coding for 4 hours straight doesn't work

## For Instructors

### Using This in a Class

**Weekly structure (recommended):**
- **Tuesday** (90 min): Cover chapter in class
  - Phases 1-3 during class time
  - Students follow along on their laptops
  - Live demo + student practice

- **Thursday** (optional, 45 min): Lab session
  - Phases 4-5 with my guidance
  - Help students who are stuck
  - Check understanding via Phase 5 challenge

- **Outside class**: Homework (60 min)
  - Students do AI exploration task
  - Manual practice
  - Reflection journal

**Assessment:**
- Use rubric at end of each chapter (10 points)
- Main grade is Phase 5 (can't fake understanding)
- Homework shows effort and reflection
- No points for copying AI code

### Teaching Notes

Each chapter includes:
- ‚úÖ **Common mistakes** students make
- ‚úÖ **Pacing suggestions** for timing
- ‚úÖ **Troubleshooting tips** if installation fails
- ‚úÖ **Extension activities** for advanced learners
- ‚úÖ **Assessment rubric** (10 points, clear criteria)

See the "Teaching Notes" section at the end of each chapter.

### Customization

Feel free to:
- Add your own examples
- Skip topics your students already know
- Add more homework
- Adjust timing for your class
- Use different AI tools than suggested

Just keep:
- The 5-phase structure (it really works)
- Phase 5 without AI (essential!)
- Manual code writing emphasis

## Homework Structure

Every chapter has the same 3-part homework:

### Part 1: AI Exploration (15 min)
Ask an AI tool specific questions about the concept. Explore variations. Take notes.

**Not about copying code.** About understanding patterns.

### Part 2: Manual Coding (30 min)
Write code from scratch. No AI help. Make it work without errors.

**This is where real learning happens.**

### Part 3: Reflection Journal (15 min)
Answer questions about what you learned:
- What was easy/hard?
- How did AI help?
- What will you remember?

**This cements learning in memory.**

## Assessment

Each chapter is worth 10 points:

| Part | Points | What it measures |
|------|--------|------------------|
| Manual code works | 3 | Can you write correct code? |
| Understanding syntax | 2 | Do you get why it works? |
| Debugging skills | 2 | Can you fix broken code? |
| AI collaboration | 2 | Do you use AI effectively? |
| Reflection | 1 | Did you think about learning? |

**The key**: Most points come from actually writing code (not using AI).

## FAQ

### "Why manual first? Can't AI just teach me?"
AI is amazing for alternatives and explanations, but understanding comes from doing. Phase 1 is where your brain engages. AI helps after.

### "Can I use AI in Phase 5?"
No. That's the whole point of Phase 5 - proving you understand independently. Plus, you'll feel awesome when you finish without help.

### "What if I get stuck on homework?"
- Re-read the chapter's Quick Reference
- Read the error message carefully
- Ask an AI tool (but understand the answer!)
- Ask your instructor
- Take a break and try again

Feeling stuck is **normal and good** - it means you're learning.

### "How fast can I do this course?"
- **Normal pace**: 1 chapter per week = 12 weeks for full course
- **Accelerated**: 1.5 chapters per week = 8 weeks
- **Leisurely**: 1 chapter every 2 weeks = 24 weeks

All are fine. Better to understand one chapter deeply than rush through all.

### "Can I skip chapters?"
If you already know a topic, you can skim the chapter but still do Phase 2 (AI exploration) - the patterns are valuable.

### "I hate error messages"
You'll love them after a few chapters. They're literally Python saying "here's what's wrong." They're helpful!

## File Organization

```
modern-python/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                    ‚Üê You are here
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md                     ‚Üê Course navigation
