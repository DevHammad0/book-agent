# Modern Python with AIDD

## Welcome to the AI-Driven Development Course

This course teaches you Python programming using the **AIDD (AI-Driven Development)** methodology‚Äîa modern approach that balances hands-on coding practice with AI tool integration.

### What is AIDD?

AIDD is a learning framework that helps you:
- **Build real coding skills** through manual practice
- **Expand your perspective** by seeing how AI approaches problems
- **Develop debugging expertise** by finding and fixing errors
- **Learn AI collaboration** and when to use AI tools effectively
- **Code independently** without relying on AI

Every chapter follows a proven 5-phase structure:
1. üß© Manual practice (you code from scratch)
2. ü§ñ AI exploration (see multiple approaches)
3. üß† Debugging (find and fix errors)
4. üí° AI collaboration (work with AI on complex problems)
5. üß± Manual challenge (prove you can do it alone)

## üìã How Each Chapter Works

### Chapter Structure
Every chapter has:
1. **Learning objectives** - What you'll be able to do
2. **Concept overview** - What you're learning and why
3. **5-phase lesson** - Following the AIDD methodology
4. **Homework** - 3 tasks to reinforce learning
5. **Assessment** - How you'll be evaluated

### The 5 AIDD Phases

**Phase 1: Manual Concept Discovery (30 min)**
- You write code from scratch
- Build intuition and understanding
- No AI assistance‚Äîthis phase is yours

**Phase 2: AI Exploration & Comparison (25 min)**
- Prompt AI tools to show different approaches
- Compare and analyze AI-generated code
- Expand your perspective

**Phase 3: Reverse Engineering & Debugging (20 min)**
- Work with intentionally buggy code
- Practice finding and fixing errors
- Understand syntax deeply

**Phase 4: Creative AI Collaboration (10 min)**
- Use AI as a partner on slightly complex problems
- Modify and adapt AI code
- Learn when and how to use AI effectively

**Phase 5: Manual Reinforcement Challenge (15 min)**
- **NO AI ALLOWED**
- Prove you understand the concept independently
- Build confidence in your ability

## ‚úÖ Getting Started

### Step 1: Install Python
Visit [python.org](https://www.python.org) and install Python 3.12 or newer.

### Step 2: Create a Learning Folder
Create a folder on your computer where you'll save all your Python files (e.g., `my-python-course`)

### Step 3: Start with Chapter 1
Go to [Chapter 1: Getting Started with Python](./01-getting-started.md) and begin!

## üìñ How to Use This Course

1. **Read the chapter** - Start with the learning objectives and overview
2. **Do Phase 1** - Write code manually following the examples
3. **Try Phase 2** - Use AI tools as suggested (this is optional if you don't have access)
4. **Practice Phase 3** - Debug the broken code examples
5. **Do Phase 4** - Work with AI on the collaborative challenge
6. **Complete Phase 5** - Write code completely independently
7. **Do homework** - Reinforce your learning with 3 practice tasks
8. **Submit for assessment** - Get feedback on your understanding

### Tips for Success
- **Type everything yourself** - Don't copy/paste (except examples to debug)
- **Run every program** - You learn by doing, not just reading
- **Don't skip Phase 5** - This is where real learning happens
- **Ask questions** - Use AI tools to explore "what if" questions
- **Make mistakes** - Errors teach you the most
- **Debug thoroughly** - Understanding errors is as important as writing code

## ü§î FAQ

**Q: Do I need prior programming experience?**
A: No! This course starts from absolute zero. Chapter 1 teaches you how to install Python.

**Q: How long does each chapter take?**
A: 90 minutes per chapter, though some phases might take longer if you experiment.

**Q: What if I don't have access to AI tools?**
A: Phases 2 and 4 can be skipped, but they're really helpful for learning. Free options include ChatGPT (free tier), Google Gemini, or Claude (limited free).

**Q: Can I go faster than one chapter per week?**
A: Yes! If you grasp concepts quickly, move forward. The key is not rushing Phase 1 and Phase 5.

**Q: What if I get stuck?**
A: Use AI tools to ask questions (they're great for that), revisit earlier phases, or ask for help from instructors/peers.

**Q: Should I use AI tools while doing Phase 5?**
A: Absolutely not! Phase 5 is your chance to prove you understand the concept independently.
