## How to Use This Course

### For Students

1. **Start with Chapter 1** - Don't skip ahead! Each chapter builds on the previous ones.
2. **Follow the 5-Phase Structure**:
   - üß© **Phase 1**: Manual practice (build your foundation)
   - ü§ñ **Phase 2**: AI exploration (see different approaches)
   - üß† **Phase 3**: Debugging (cement your understanding)
   - üí° **Phase 4**: AI collaboration (apply what you learned)
   - üß± **Phase 5**: Manual challenge (prove independence)

3. **Complete All Homework** - Each chapter has 3 parts:
   - AI exploration task
   - Manual coding practice
   - Reflection journal

4. **Don't Skip Errors** - When you get an error, it's a learning moment! Read the message carefully.

5. **Use AI Wisely** - AI is a tool for learning, not a replacement for learning.

### For Instructors

- Each chapter is designed for ~90 minutes of class time
- Phase 5 (Manual Challenge) should be done in class to verify student understanding
- The rubric at the end of each chapter provides clear assessment criteria
- Teaching notes include common issues and solutions
- Feel free to extend chapters with additional examples or projects

### Time Estimates

- **Per Chapter**: 90 minutes class time
- **Homework**: 45-60 minutes outside class
- **Full Course**: ~12 weeks at 1 chapter/week
- **Accelerated**: ~8 weeks if doing 1.5 chapters/week

## Prerequisites

### Before Starting

You need:
- ‚úÖ Python 3.8 or higher installed on your computer
- ‚úÖ A text editor (VS Code, Sublime, even Notepad works)
- ‚úÖ Terminal/command prompt access
- ‚úÖ An AI tool (Claude Code, ChatGPT, Gemini, or GitHub Copilot)
- ‚úÖ Willingness to write code and make mistakes!

### What You'll Have After Completing This Course

You'll be able to:
- ‚úÖ Write Python programs from scratch
- ‚úÖ Understand how to debug code
- ‚úÖ Use AI tools effectively for programming
- ‚úÖ Read and understand other people's code
- ‚úÖ Apply Python to real problems
- ‚úÖ Continue learning independently

## Learning Philosophy: AIDD

**AI-Driven Development (AIDD)** is a teaching approach that:

1. **Starts with manual practice** - You code by hand first
2. **Expands with AI perspectives** - See how AI solves the same problem
3. **Emphasizes debugging** - Fix broken code to understand syntax
4. **Balances AI & independence** - Use AI as a tool, not a crutch
5. **Reflects on learning** - Think about what you learned and why

**Key Principle**: By the end of each chapter, you should be able to write that concept WITHOUT AI help. AI is for exploration, not dependence.

## Course Structure

### Each Chapter Contains

1. **Learning Objectives** (5 clear, measurable goals)
2. **5 Phases** (manual ‚Üí AI ‚Üí debugging ‚Üí collaboration ‚Üí reinforcement)
3. **Code Examples** (complete, runnable, commented)
4. **Activities** (hands-on practice with timing)
5. **Homework** (3 components: explore, practice, reflect)
6. **Assessment** (10-point rubric)
7. **Key Takeaways** (quick reference)
8. **Teaching Notes** (for instructors)

### How Difficulty Increases

- **Chapters 1-3**: Basics (print, variables, conditionals)
- **Chapters 4-5**: Control flow (loops, functions)
- **Chapters 6-7**: Data structures (lists, dictionaries)
- **Chapters 8-9**: Real-world skills (file I/O, errors)
- **Chapters 10-12**: Professional practices (OOP, modules)

## Getting Help

### When You're Stuck

1. **Read the error message carefully** - Python tells you what's wrong
2. **Check the Quick Reference** at the end of the chapter
3. **Review the Common Mistakes** section
4. **Ask AI** with a specific question: "Why does this give a syntax error?"
5. **Talk to your instructor** - they've seen this before!

### Common Issues

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Python won't install | Check PATH setting, or use full path to run |
| `SyntaxError` | Check quotes, parentheses, colons, indentation |
| `NameError` | Check spelling and capitalization |
| Code runs but wrong output | Read the error, check logic, use print() to debug |
| AI code is confusing | Ask AI to explain specific lines, don't just copy |

## Tools You'll Need

### Required
- **Python 3.8+** (free, open source)
- **Text Editor** (VS Code recommended, it's free)
- **Terminal/Command Prompt** (comes with your OS)
- **AI Tool** (Claude Code, ChatGPT, Gemini, GitHub Copilot)

### Recommended
- **VS Code** with Python extension (free)
- **GitHub account** (free) - for sharing code later
- **Note-taking app** for reflection journals
