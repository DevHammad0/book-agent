# AIDD Python Book Chapter Generator

## Overview

This skill helps you generate Python educational content using the **AI-Driven Development (AIDD)** pedagogical approach. This methodology ensures students genuinely learn programming fundamentals while developing modern AI collaboration skills.

**NEW in v2.0:** Automatically generates separate files for each topic in a documentation site structure, ensuring sequential learning with no forward references.

## Documentation Site Generation

### File Organization

When generating chapters, create files in this structure:

```
modern-python/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.md                          # Main navigation/table of contents
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01-getting-started.md            # Week 1: Setup and basics
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02-variables-and-types.md        # Week 2: Variables
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03-conditionals.md               # Week 3: If/else
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 04-loops.md                      # Week 4: For/while loops
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 05-functions.md                  # Week 5: Functions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 06-lists.md                      # Week 6: Lists
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 07-dictionaries.md               # Week 7: Dictionaries
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 08-file-io.md                    # Week 8: File handling
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 09-error-handling.md             # Week 9: Try/except
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 10-oop-basics.md                 # Week 10: Classes
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 11-oop-advanced.md               # Week 11: Inheritance
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 12-modules-packages.md           # Week 12: Imports
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                        # Project overview
```

### File Generation Rules

**CRITICAL RULES for Sequential Learning:**

1. **Self-Contained Chapters**
   - Each file must be complete and standalone
   - Explain everything needed for that topic
   - No assumptions about future chapters

2. **No Forward References**
   - NEVER mention topics not yet covered
   - Don't say "we'll learn about X later"
   - Don't use syntax/concepts from future chapters
   - If you need something not covered yet, explain it briefly inline

3. **Clear Prerequisites**
   - State exactly what prior chapters are needed
   - Reference specific chapter numbers
   - Quick recap of essential prior concepts

4. **Progressive Complexity**
   - Start simple, build gradually
   - Each chapter slightly harder than previous
   - Concepts build on each other naturally

5. **Consistent Format**
   - Every file follows same AIDD 5-phase structure
   - Same heading hierarchy
   - Same assessment format

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Generate a full lesson plan for teaching a Python topic
- Create a book chapter following AIDD methodology
- Design exercises that balance manual and AI-assisted learning
- Structure assessments that test both coding ability and AI collaboration
- Develop content for modern Python education (post-2023)
- **Build a complete Python documentation site with sequential chapters**
- **Generate individual chapter files in a structured directory**

## File Generation Workflow

### Step 1: Setup Directory Structure

When user provides a directory path (e.g., "modern-python"), create or use this structure:

```bash
# Create directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p modern-python

# Initialize with index and README
# Start generating chapters sequentially
```

### Step 2: Track Chapter Sequence

Maintain awareness of what has been generated:

**Generated Topics:** Keep track in a mental model or explicitly
- Chapter 1: Variables ‚úÖ
- Chapter 2: Conditionals ‚úÖ
- Chapter 3: Loops ‚Üê Currently generating
- Chapter 4: Functions ‚è≥ Not yet

**When generating Chapter 3 (Loops):**
- ‚úÖ CAN reference: Variables, Conditionals (already covered)
- ‚ùå CANNOT reference: Functions, Lists, OOP (not covered yet)
- If need something not covered: Explain it inline briefly

### Step 3: Generate Complete Chapter File

For each topic, create a complete markdown file:

**Filename format:** `##-topic-name.md`
- Use 2-digit prefix for ordering (01, 02, 03...)
- Use kebab-case for topic name
- Examples: `03-loops.md`, `05-functions.md`, `10-oop-basics.md`

**File content must include:**
1. Chapter title with number
2. Prerequisites section (what chapters to complete first)
3. Complete AIDD 5-phase lesson
4. All code examples (no placeholders)
5. Homework section
6. Assessment rubric
7. Navigation (Previous | Home | Next chapter links)

### Step 4: Update Index File

After generating each chapter, update `index.md` with:
- Chapter number and title
- Brief description
- Status (‚úÖ Complete, ‚è≥ In Progress, ‚¨ú Planned)
- Link to the file

### Step 5: Maintain README.md

Keep README.md updated with:
- Total chapters completed
- How to use the documentation
- Suggested learning path
- Prerequisites for starting

## File Template Structure

Each generated chapter file should follow this structure:

```markdown
# Chapter [N]: [Topic Name] in the AI Era

> **Navigation:** [‚Üê Previous: Chapter [N-1]](./[prev-file].md) | [Home](./index.md) | [Next: Chapter [N+1] ‚Üí](./[next-file].md)

```

## Chapter Generation Workflow

### IMPORTANT: File Generation Process

When a user requests a chapter, follow these steps:

**Step A: Determine Chapter Number**
- Ask user what chapter number this is (or infer from topic sequence)
- Check what topics have been covered previously
- Identify prerequisites

**Step B: Check Prerequisites**
- List what concepts must be already covered
- Verify no forward references will be made
- Plan what to explain inline if needed

**Step C: Generate Complete File**
- Create file with proper naming: `##-topic-name.md`
- Include ALL content (no "see templates" placeholders)
- Write complete, runnable code examples
- Add navigation links

**Step D: Save to Directory**
- Use `create_file` tool to write to specified directory
- Path format: `/home/claude/[directory-name]/##-topic-name.md`
- Then copy to outputs: `/mnt/user-data/outputs/[directory-name]/`

**Step E: Update Index**
- Update or create `index.md` in the same directory
- Add new chapter to table of contents
- Mark as complete

**Example Workflow:**
```
User: "Create Chapter 3 on loops in modern-python directory"

Claude:
1. Determines: Chapter 3, topic is loops
2. Prerequisites: Chapters 1-2 (variables, conditionals)
3. Generates complete 03-loops.md file
4. Saves to /home/claude/modern-python/03-loops.md
5. Copies to /mnt/user-data/outputs/modern-python/
6. Updates index.md
7. Provides download link
```

### Step 1: Identify the Topic and Context

Before generating content, clarify:
- **Python Topic**: What specific concept (e.g., loops, functions, OOP, data structures)
- **Week/Module Number**: Where it fits in the curriculum
- **Prerequisites**: What students should already know
- **Duration**: Typical lesson length (default: 90 minutes)
- **Target AI Tools**: Which AI tools students will use (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, etc.)

### Step 2: Generate the Chapter Structure

Every AIDD chapter follows this structure:

```markdown
# Week X: [Topic Name] in the AI Era

## Module Context
- Where this fits in the course
- Prerequisites from previous weeks
- Overall learning goal

## üéØ Learning Objectives
By the end of the week, students will be able to:
- [Objective 1 - Manual coding skill]
- [Objective 2 - Conceptual understanding]
- [Objective 3 - AI collaboration skill]
- [Objective 4 - Debugging/problem-solving skill]
- [Objective 5 - Synthesis/comparison skill]

## üìö Lesson Flow (90 minutes)

### üß© Phase 1: Manual Concept Discovery (30 minutes)

## üß≠ Assessment
[Rubric with 4 criteria: Manual correctness, AI collaboration, Debugging, Reflection]

## üß† Teaching Notes
[Key points for instructors]
```

### Step 3: Populate with Topic-Specific Content

Use these guidelines for each phase:

#### Phase 1 - Manual Concept Discovery
**Goal**: Build intuition without AI interference

**Components:**
- Start with simplest example of the concept
- Explain what happens "under the hood" (memory, execution flow)
- Provide 2-3 manual exercises increasing in complexity
- Include a discussion question that explores edge cases or reasoning

**Example Patterns:**
- "Write [simple code] by hand"
- "Explain when [approach A] vs [approach B] would be more appropriate"
- "Why might [common mistake] happen?"

#### Phase 2 - AI Exploration & Comparison
**Goal**: Show students multiple perspectives and best practices

**Components:**
- 1-2 specific AI prompts (with tool names: Gemini CLI, Claude Code)
- Expected AI output with 2-4 different approaches
- Instructor-led comparison questions:
  - "Which method is clearest?"
  - "Which uses more memory/time?"
  - "Which would you use in production?"
- Mini reflection on AI code quality

**AI Tool Prompt Templates:**
```
gemini "Show [N] different ways to [task] in Python and explain efficiency."

claude-code "Write a Python program that [description] and explain your approach."

copilot (comment prompt)
# Generate a [function/class] that [specification]
# Consider edge cases: [list cases]
```

#### Phase 3 - Reverse Engineering & Debugging
**Goal**: Learn syntax through fixing mistakes

**Components:**
- Provide intentionally buggy AI-generated code (1-2 bugs)
- Common mistakes related to the topic:
  - Off-by-one errors
  - Missing increments in loops
  - Incorrect indentation
  - Type mismatches
  - Logic errors
- Guided questions: "Why does this fail?" "How would you fix it?"
- Compare student reasoning with AI's explanation

**Bug Types by Topic:**
- Loops: Infinite loops, wrong range, incorrect increment
- Functions: Missing return, parameter mismatch, scope issues
- Data Structures: Index errors, key errors, mutation bugs
- OOP: Missing self, wrong inheritance, attribute errors

#### Phase 4 - Creative AI Collaboration
**Goal**: Build confidence in AI-assisted problem solving

**Components:**
- Open-ended problem slightly beyond current skill level
- Students prompt AI and get working code
- Required manual modifications:
  - "Explain what [specific part] does"
  - "Rewrite [section] to [new requirement]"
  - "Optimize for [readability/performance]"
- Discussion of trade-offs

**Problem Complexity Guideline:**
- Should take AI ~30 seconds to generate
- Should require student understanding to modify correctly
- Should have multiple valid approaches

#### Phase 5 - Manual Reinforcement Challenge
**Goal**: Prove independent capability

**Components:**
- **Strictly NO AI allowed** - make this explicit
- Time-boxed (10-15 minutes)
- Problem uses the day's concept applied to new scenario
- Students must code from scratch
- Verify together as class
- Optional: Compare with how AI might approach it (after completion)

**Challenge Characteristics:**
- Slightly easier than Phase 4
- Uses the exact syntax/patterns taught
- Clear success criteria
- Should be completable manually

### Step 4: Create Homework Assignments

Every homework should have three components:

1. **AI Interaction Task**
   - Prompt AI for creative applications or variations
   - Require students to pick and modify one example
   - Focus on exploration and understanding

2. **Manual Task**
   - Pure coding without AI
   - Reinforces the core concept
   - Should take 15-30 minutes

3. **Reflection Journal**
   - "What syntax patterns do you now recognize?"
   - "How did AI help you understand [concept]?"
   - Metacognitive practice

### Step 5: Design Assessment Rubric

Standard 10-point rubric structure:

| Criterion | Description | Points |
|-----------|-------------|--------|
| Manual coding correctness | Accurate, working Python syntax | 3 |
| AI collaboration | Effective prompt use and code explanation | 3 |
| Debugging reasoning | Clear identification and fix of logic errors | 2 |
| Reflection clarity | Insight into what AI helped explain | 2 |

## Core AIDD Philosophy

**The Five-Phase Learning Framework:**
1. **Manual Concept Discovery** - Build foundational understanding through hands-on coding
2. **AI Exploration & Comparison** - Expand perspective by seeing multiple approaches
3. **Reverse Engineering & Debugging** - Cement syntax through problem-solving
4. **Creative AI Collaboration** - Apply knowledge with AI assistance
5. **Manual Reinforcement Challenge** - Ensure independence from AI tools

**Key Principle:** Manual practice builds understanding ‚Üí AI expands perspective ‚Üí Debugging cements syntax ‚Üí Reflection builds mastery

## Topic-Specific Guidance

### Common Python Topics and Key Focus Areas

**Variables & Data Types**

## Best Practices

### Do's ‚úÖ
- **Always start with manual practice** before introducing AI
- **Use specific AI tool names** (Gemini CLI, Claude Code, not just "AI")
- **Include the actual code** in examples, not just descriptions
- **Make bugs realistic** - errors students would actually make
- **Time-box each phase** - keeps lesson moving
- **Require manual completion** in Phase 5 - non-negotiable
- **Balance breadth and depth** - don't overwhelm with too many concepts

### Don'ts ‚ùå
- **Don't skip Phase 1** - manual foundation is critical
- **Don't make AI optional** - it's core to the methodology
- **Don't use vague prompts** - show exact commands students should use
- **Don't make debugging trivial** - bugs should require thought
- **Don't allow AI in Phase 5** - defeats the purpose
- **Don't forget reflection** - metacognition is key to learning
- **Don't assume prior AI experience** - teach prompting explicitly

## Example Prompts for Content Generation

When a user requests chapter generation, use these patterns:

**For a new chapter:**
```
User: "Create an AIDD chapter on Python dictionaries"

Generate:
1. Module context and prerequisites
2. 5 learning objectives (manual + AI + debugging + synthesis)
3. 5-phase lesson structure with timings
4. Specific code examples for each phase
5. Homework with 3 components
6. 10-point assessment rubric
```

**For expanding a section:**
```
User: "Expand Phase 3 for the functions chapter"

Provide:
1. 2-3 buggy code examples
2. Guided debugging questions
3. Common student mistakes
4. AI comparison activity
```

**For creating assessments:**
```
User: "Create assessment for OOP chapter"

Generate:
1. 4-criterion rubric (10 points total)
2. Example of excellent work for each criterion
3. Common mistakes that lose points
```
